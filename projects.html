            <h2>Palestine Map Project</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Palestine Map Project! This project is a Java-based program that provides a map of Palestine containing fifteen cities.
                 The program is designed to find the shortest route between two cities using two different
                  algorithms: Uniform Cost Search ( <strong>UCS</strong> ) and <strong>A *</strong> .</p>
            <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Displays a map of Palestine with fifteen cities marked.</li>
              <li>Utilizes two algorithms, Uniform Cost Search and A Star, to find the shortest route between two cities.</li>
              <li>Provides detailed information about the shortest route found.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Installation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clone the repository:</li>
              <li>Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.</li>
              <li>Compile and run the mainAIProject.class file to start the program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Upon running the program, you will be presented with a map of Palestine containing fifteen cities.</li>
              <li>Enter the names of the two cities between which you want to find the shortest route.</li>
              <li>Choose the algorithm (Uniform Cost Search or A Star) to find the route.</li>
              <li>The program will display the shortest route along with detailed information such as distance, time, etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Spring-Boot-Hotel-Management-System</h2>
        <p>Introduction: This repository contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a comprehensive Hotel Management System. The ERD is a crucial component for understanding the database structure, which is essential for the management and operation of a hotel. It outlines the various entities involved in the system, such as employees, customers, rooms, bookings, and more, along with their attributes and relationships.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this ERD is to provide a clear and organized visual representation of the database schema. It helps developers, database administrators, and stakeholders to comprehend how data is interconnected and to ensure that the system is designed for efficient data management and retrieval. This diagram will serve as a blueprint for implementing the database, ensuring that all necessary relationships and constraints are in place to maintain data integrity and support the functionality of the hotel management system.</p>
